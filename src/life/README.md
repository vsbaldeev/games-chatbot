Жора's scheduled life posts — the character's own story, told to every chat twice a
week and remembered as canon — plus a silent daily activity refresh that keeps
"what are you doing right now" fresh between posts.

## Flow

```
src/jobs/life_post.py (schedule) ──► src/life/poster.py:post_life_episode(bot)
    │
    ├─ src/life/writer.py: EpisodeWriterAgent.write_episode()
    │      reads bot_memories.get_recent_episodes(10) + get_writer_facts()
    │      (20 newest + 10 sampled older) + get_recent_activities(7);
    │      src/life/engagement.choose_mode() picks how this post engages
    │      the chat (see below) → prompts EPISODE_WRITER_SYSTEM (today's
    │      date/season + dated recent activities via calendar_ru, for
    │      season-appropriate and non-contradicting episodes) → strict JSON
    │      {episode_text, image_prompt, voice_script, voice_teaser,
    │        current_activity, format} → parse_episode validates lengths
    │        (episode_text ≤ 450, voice_script ≤ 500, voice_teaser ≤ 120)
    │        and required fields; one retry on a malformed/invalid
    │        response, then None (slot skipped, catch-up retries later)
    │
    ├─ resolve_media: build the episode's media once, before the fan-out —
    │      voice: synthesize the spoken story (prepare_tts_text +
    │      speech_service.synthesize); photo: generate the selfie on the
    │      imagegen service (CHARACTER_VISUAL_PROMPT + the episode's
    │      image_prompt via src/imagegen/client.py). Any failure demotes
    │      the episode to a story — a media failure never kills a post
    │
    ├─ send_episode: fan out to every chat (achievements.get_all_chat_ids,
    │      asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True) — one chat's failure
    │      cannot abort the others), record each send in unified_messages
    │      (content = episode_text even for voice posts, so the bot's own
    │      posts need no transcription/vision when a member replies to them)
    │
    └─ only if ≥1 chat received the post:
           record_episode → bot_memories.insert_episode(...) with the
           episode's current_activity, then distill_facts (BOT_FACT_DISTILL_SYSTEM
           + MEMORY_MODEL, reasoning disabled) → bot_memories.upsert_facts(...)
           (semantic dedup, newest text wins on a match)
```

Zero successful sends leaves `bot_memories` untouched — the watermark
(`get_latest_posted_at`) stays behind, so catch-up retries the slot on the
next startup instead of silently losing it.

## Engagement — `src/life/engagement.py`

Жора's posts don't just narrate his own life — each one either asks the chat
a question or pulls a real member into the story:

- **SOLO** (`MEMBER_MODE_CHANCE = 0.5` chance of *not* landing on MEMBER):
  the episode closes with a question or callout aimed at the chat.
- **MEMBER**: `collect_mentionable_facts()` gathers `(username, fact)` pairs
  across every registered chat from `user_memories` (in practice a single
  friend group — life posts broadcast identically everywhere, matching
  `bot_memories`' "one life" design), `is_safe_to_mention` drops counter-tally
  facts («Оскорблял бота N раз», «Пытался взломать бота N раз») and
  second-hand cross-user facts («по словам @X, ...») since broadcasting
  either would misrepresent or embarrass the member, and one surviving
  candidate is picked at random. The writer prompt is instructed to weave
  the fact in warmly and to soften or drop it if it reads as too personal —
  the prefix filter is a mechanical first pass, not a full judgment call.
  Falls back to SOLO when no eligible candidate exists (fresh install, or
  every stored fact is filtered out) or the lookup itself fails — a broken
  personalization query must never block a scheduled post.

The mode is picked once per post, before the writer prompt is built, and is
not re-picked on the one retry attempt.

## Voice posts — teaser caption, story in the voice

People skip long voice notes that give no reason to press play, so a voice
post never shows its full text. The caption is only `voice_teaser` — one dry
hook line in Жора's style («Про медведя, мёд и одну плохую идею.»), never a
summary — while the full episode lives in the spoken `voice_script`, which
must be self-contained and carry the engagement question/mention (in MEMBER
mode the teaser may hint «тут кое-что про одного из вас» but only the voice
names the member). Scripts are capped at `EPISODE_VOICE_SCRIPT_MAX_CHARS`
(500 ≈ 25–40 s of Silero speech, tighter than the general `TTS_MAX_CHARS`
synthesis limit) so the duration Telegram shows before playing stays a
low-commitment tap. Reply-context needs no transcription:
`unified_messages.content` records the full `episode_text` even though
members see only the teaser.

## Photo posts — text–photo coherence

A photo post must never contradict its caption. Three layers guarantee it:
one episode JSON produces both `episode_text` (the caption) and
`image_prompt` (the shot), so they cannot describe different events by
construction; the writer prompt requires `image_prompt` to be **one simple
frame from the episode** — the most visual single moment, not a retelling
of the whole plot — that may omit parts of the story but may never
contradict it (same place, season, time of day, only objects the story
contains); and the poster always sends the image *with* `episode_text` as
its caption — an image failure degrades the post to `story`, so a bare or
mismatched photo is never posted. The fragment framing is deliberate and
measured: across seed sweeps, two-subject-plus-interaction prompts failed
the vision judge on 3 of 4 seeds (the second creature simply doesn't
render), while a single-subject action frame scored 9/10 within three
candidates. Hence the writer rule: ideally just Жора and one action in
frame, a second participant only when the shot is meaningless without
one — exactly like a real chat post where the story is in the text and
the attached photo shows one detail of it. The character's appearance is deliberately absent from
`image_prompt`: the fixed `CHARACTER_VISUAL_PROMPT` descriptor is prepended
at generation time, so every selfie shares wardrobe/beard/style while the
scene tracks the episode. The photo format is only offered to the writer
when `IMAGEGEN_URL` is configured (`live_formats()`).

A fourth layer lives on the service side: `CHARACTER_VISUAL_PROMPT +
image_prompt` routinely exceeds CLIP's 77-token limit, and a plain
`prompt=` string would silently truncate — dropping exactly the episode's
scene detail. `imagegen-service/engine.py` builds embeddings via Compel
instead, so the full prompt always reaches the model (see that service's
README for the story of the bug this replaced).

The fifth layer attacks the model's remaining weakness — SD1.5 renders
subject *interactions* stochastically (all subjects present, nobody doing
what the caption says). `generate_best_photo` generates up to
`IMAGEGEN_CANDIDATES` (3) candidates with random seeds and
`src/life/photo_judge.py` scores each against the episode's `image_prompt`
via the existing Groq vision model (0–10, interaction weighted heaviest,
same multimodal pattern as `src/pipeline/ingester.py`). The first candidate
scoring ≥ `PHOTO_JUDGE_PASS_SCORE` (7) ships immediately (early exit saves
CPU-minutes); otherwise the best-scoring one ships — **the judge ranks, it
never gates**: a photo post degrades to a text story only when every
generation call itself failed. A judge outage scores as "unknown" (ranked
below any scored candidate, still postable) — a broken judge must never
block a scheduled post. The episode writer is also instructed to keep
`image_prompt` renderable: one subject-verb-object action, at most one
other creature, no prop lists.

Recording uses `format_photo_content(episode_text)` plus the sent photo's
`file_id`, which plugs Жора's selfies into the existing lazy
vision-description path — a member replying to a selfie gets a real
description of the generated frame, same as for member photos.

## Format degradation ladder

`voice → story`, `photo → story`: media payloads are built once before the
fan-out (`resolve_media`), and any media failure demotes the episode to a
text story — the recorded format is the demoted one, so the
never-repeat-format rule sees what was actually posted. Step 8 extends the
mapping with `video_note → voice → story`; a media failure always demotes
the post, never kills it.

## Scheduling — `src/jobs/life_post.py`

- Exactly `LIFE_POSTS_PER_WEEK = 2` posts per ISO week, on random days at a
  random minute inside `LIFE_POST_WINDOW` (10:00–22:00, Moscow Time —
  `Europe/Moscow`, fixed UTC+3, no DST). `week_plan(now)` is a deterministic seeded plan
  (`random.Random(f"life-{iso_year}-{iso_week}")`) — no schedule table, and
  calling it at any point during the week returns the same plan.
- `life_post_job` runs daily at the window start (`LIFE_POST_RUN_TIME`,
  10:00 local) and schedules a one-off `run_once` at the planned minute when
  today is one of the week's two planned days.
- `catch_up_life_post_job` runs once at startup (+60s):
  - no episode has ever been posted → this is a fresh deployment; the very
    first life post is scheduled immediately (or deferred to the next
    daytime window if the bot started at night) — Жора's opener.
  - otherwise, recovers a missed scheduled slot the same way, comparing
    `bot_memories.get_latest_posted_at()` against `most_recent_due_slot`.
- Night is quiet hours for **proactive** posts only — the reactive pipeline
  (mentions, replies) is untouched and answers around the clock.

## Canon write rules

Canon (`bot_memories`) is written only by scheduled jobs — chat members
cannot inject it. The episode writer sees the last 10 episodes plus a
20-newest/10-sampled-older slice of facts (never the whole store), so canon
holds months of detail without blowing the prompt budget. `current_activity`
is stored on both `episode` rows (life posts) and `activity` rows (the daily
refresh below); whichever is newest is the pipeline's answer for «что делаешь
сейчас». Reply-prompt injection is question-gated: the activity enters the
prompt only when the message asks what he's doing/did, or on a rare volunteer
roll (see `src/pipeline/README.md`) — the refresh mechanics here are
unchanged by that gate.

## Daily activity refresh — `src/life/activity.py`, `src/jobs/daily_activity.py`

Life posts land only twice a week, so between them `current_activity` used
to sit frozen for days (the exact "рубит дрова for a week" bug this refresh
fixes) and then go stale and get improvised inconsistently. A lightweight
daily job closes that gap without ever posting to chat:

```
src/jobs/daily_activity.py (09:30 MSK, before the 10:00 life-post window)
    │ skip if bot_memories.get_current_activity() already dates to today
    │   (an earlier refresh, or a life post that already landed)
    ▼
src/life/activity.py: refresh_daily_activity()
    reads bot_memories.get_recent_activities(10) + get_facts(5)
    → build_activity_prompt: today's date/weekday/season (calendar_ru) +
      dated recent activities ("не повторяй их") + canon facts
    → DAILY_ACTIVITY_SYSTEM (ChatGroq, config.ACTIVITY_MODEL, temp 0.9,
      single call, up to 2 attempts) → one bare phrase, not JSON
    → parse_activity_phrase: strips think-blocks/quotes, drops (retry) if
      empty or over CURRENT_ACTIVITY_MAX_CHARS (80)
    → bot_memories.insert_activity(phrase) — kind='activity', capped at
      MAX_BOT_ACTIVITIES (30, oldest pruned)
```

Fails soft: any exception or two unusable attempts just leave yesterday's
activity in place (it ages from "fresh" into "recent" phrasing) — a broken
refresh must never crash the job. `catch_up_daily_activity_job` recovers a
refresh missed while the bot was down, same as the life-post catch-up.

`src/life/calendar_ru.py` renders the shared Russian date/weekday/season and
relative-day ("вчера", "позавчера", "8 июля") phrasing consumed by this
generator, the episode writer (season-appropriate episodes, continuity with
recent activities) and the response prompt (dated "what did you do
yesterday" answers via `bot_recent_activities`, see `src/pipeline/README.md`).

## Shared helper

`load_json_object` (used to parse the writer's JSON output) lives in
`src/utils/llm_json.py`, extracted from `src/jobs/roles.py` so both jobs
share one implementation.
